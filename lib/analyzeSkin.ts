    Oily: "Your skin produces excess sebum, giving it a shiny appearance. This is often genetic but can be influenced by hormones, climate, and skincare products. Oily skin is more prone to acne but typically ages more slowly than other skin types.",
    Dry: "Your skin produces less sebum than normal, leading to a lack of moisture and natural oils. This can make your skin feel tight and appear flaky. Dry skin is more prone to fine lines and irritation.",
    Combination:
      "Your skin has both oily and dry areas. Typically, the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) is oily, while the cheeks are dry or normal. This requires balanced skincare that addresses both concerns.",
    Normal:
      "Your skin is well-balanced, neither too oily nor too dry. It has good circulation, a smooth texture, and small pores. While this is the ideal skin type, it still requires proper maintenance.",
    Sensitive:
      "Your skin reacts easily to products, environmental factors, or allergens. It may become red, itchy, or irritated. Sensitive skin requires gentle, fragrance-free products and careful introduction of new ingredients.",
  }

  // Create explanations for concerns
  const concernExplanations = {
    Acne: "Acne occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. Factors like hormones, diet, and stress can contribute to breakouts. A consistent cleansing routine and targeted treatments can help manage acne.",
    Wrinkles:
      "Wrinkles form as skin loses elasticity and collagen with age. Sun exposure, smoking, and facial expressions accelerate their development. Regular use of sunscreen and anti-aging ingredients like retinol can help minimize their appearance.",
    "Dark spots":
      "Dark spots, or hyperpigmentation, occur when skin produces excess melanin. They can be caused by sun exposure, hormonal changes, or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Ingredients like vitamin C and niacinamide can help fade these spots.",
    Dehydration:
      "Dehydrated skin lacks water, making it feel tight and look dull. Unlike dry skin, dehydration is a temporary condition that can affect any skin type. Hydrating serums with hyaluronic acid can help restore moisture balance.",
    Redness:
      "Skin redness can be caused by sensitivity, rosacea, or irritation. It often worsens with heat, spicy foods, alcohol, or harsh skincare products. Soothing ingredients like centella asiatica and green tea can help calm redness.",
    "Uneven texture":
      "Uneven skin texture can result from dead skin buildup, scarring, or enlarged pores. Regular exfoliation with AHAs or BHAs can help smooth the skin surface and improve overall texture.",
    "Enlarged pores":
      "Pores appear larger when they're clogged with oil and dead skin cells or when skin loses elasticity. Regular cleansing, exfoliation, and products with niacinamide can help minimize their appearance.",
    "Fine lines":
      "Fine lines are the early stages of wrinkles, often appearing around the eyes and mouth. They're primarily caused by sun damage, facial movements, and the natural aging process. Hydration and ingredients like peptides can help minimize their appearance.",
